Assignment 2
1. Yes, the program outputs garbage values. This is because of context switching between the producer and the consumer. When the waiting process resumes, this process runs from the previous state stored in the PCB. Hence the garbage values.

2. Not all the values are getting consumed by the consumer. For a small count of value 8, the final value 8 is being printed by the consumer. Xinu does execute processes concurrently, Inspite of that, the producer runs to the end of its execution cycle before the consumer starts executing.

Producer() - Srikanth - The Producer is the first process to run from the main. The job of the producer is to iterate through a loop for a user defined count or default count of 2000, initialise a value in incremental order to the shared buffer n and prints out the produced value.

Consumer() - Vishwas - The consumer function iterates through a loop for a user defined count or default count of 2000, and prints the value of shared buffer/ global variable n.

The main function and the header file were written collaboratively between the two.
